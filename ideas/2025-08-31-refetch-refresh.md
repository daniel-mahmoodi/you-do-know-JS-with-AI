# Refetch or Refresh Handling

## Problem
I had an error related to this snippet in my code:
```js
refetch() || router.refresh();
```
# Here’s why it fails:

If refetch is undefined, calling refetch() will throw an error before router.refresh() even runs.
The || operator only checks values, but you’re calling refetch() first, so it crashes.

# My Solution
```js
if (refetch) {
  refetch(); // only call if defined
} else {
  router.refresh(); // fallback
}
```
# AI Suggestion

```js
refetch?.() ?? router.refresh();
```

# Why It's Better

Cleaner and shorter syntax.
Uses optional chaining (?.) to safely call refetch only if it exists.
Uses nullish coalescing (??) to ensure router.refresh() runs when refetch is undefined or null.
