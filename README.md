# you-do-know-JS-with-AI

This repository is a personal knowledge base where I collect coding solutions and improvements suggested by AI.

Each solution includes:
- The problem I faced
- My own initial solution
- The AI’s suggestion
- Why the AI’s approach is better

This helps me track my learning and reuse better solutions in future projects.
